## General Information
- Can build a tree of integers
- Can search for data in the tree
- This is a personal project as practice with recursion and pointers


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Runs tests to ensure proper functionality
- Displays basic memory allocation data

## Setup
I am using the GNU C++ compiler to run my programs, examples will be using the g++ compiler. I am also using kate as my text editor.

To install:
- Choose the desired location to clone git into
Clone git:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/valle572/binary-tree.git
```

Open folder:
```sh
cd binary-tree
```
For README:
```sh
kate README.md
```
To compile:
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o main
```

## Usage
The program does not use any user input.

To run from binary-tree folder:
```sh
./main
```


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_


## Room for Improvement
Some things that can be improved are the:
- readability
- maintainability
- program is likely doing more than it needs to

To do:
- Shorten beginTests() function
- Remove unnecessary code
